[Avant - Verse 1]
Baby i know when we started out
there were things you didn't
know, but babygirl we got a
lotta things we
Need to discuss i know i'm
asking for allot, but just
trust. you say that things
gettin old sneakin'
Round creepin' and love on the
low but babygurl i can't wait
till' it's officially us, i
can't wait to
Let them know about us.
[Nicole]
First i tought that i could
take you boy but i don't know,
you told me you were gonna
leave her for me
Long ago.
[Avant]
Eventually i will but i just
gotta take it slow don't wanna
break her heart, altough i
gotta let her go
So baby ..
[Avant - Chorus]
So please don't say you wanna
give up.
How do i tell her that i'm
fallen in love,
And i know your waiting
paciently for that day,
When we no longer have to lie
about us.
When i walk around all i want
is your touch,
And when you call me i don't
wanna hang up,
And i know i say it often but i
can't wait
Till' we no longer have to lie
about us.
[Avant - Verse 2]
Baby i know situation don't
seem fair to us both.
But babygirl, she's an issue
that i'm bout to adjust.
Don't mistake our love is ment
for just us,
You are my soul, mind, body,
spirit all that i know.
But babygirl i can't wait till'
it's officially us, i can't
Wait to tell the world about us.
